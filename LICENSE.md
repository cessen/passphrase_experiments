There are two files that are an exception to that, which are:

* `other_lists/diceware_wordlist.txt` the original diceware word list, used mainly for comparison when testing.
* `other_lists/source_dictionary.txt`, which is a copy of the default American-English dictionary on my Ubuntu Linux system.
